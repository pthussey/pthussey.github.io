<p>In this post I’ll describe the steps I took to get this website hosted online. This is a follow-up post to <a href="http://www.paulhussey.kr/post/how_I_built_this_website.html">this one</a> which describes how I built this site from scratch using <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing I had to do was decide what platform to use to host my site. This includes deciding whether I would host it as a dynamic web app or as static pages. My website does not require any dynamic server responses to requests from users, so I had the choice to do it either way. I also had to choose whether or not I would be willing to pay for hosting. I looked at three different options: Google Cloud, Heroku, and GitHub Pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp/">Google Cloud</a><br />
With Google Cloud you can use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> for dynamic apps or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website">Cloud Storage</a> for static websites. When you create a Google Cloud account you get $300 in free credits that must be used within 90 days, after which you are charged for use of the platform. For a small site like mine I’m sure the cost would be low, but it’s not free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a><br />
Heroku is a platform for hosting dynamic applications. It has a free tier that, unlike Google Cloud, remains free regardless of how long you use it. The catch is that your app goes into a sleep mode if it remains inactive for 30 minutes or longer and it takes a bit of time to wake-up when a user accesses it.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a><br />
GitHub Pages is a platform within GitHub that you can use to host static websites directly from a repository. It’s free to use for a public repository but you need to upgrade if you want to use a private repository.</p>
<p>I considered these options and chose to use GitHub Pages to host my site. There was no reason really to host it as a dynamic app, and for a static website the hosting is free without any hitches like slow loading. And, being a GitHub user already made the choice even easier. If I do make some dynamic apps in the future for things like data dashboards I think I will try Heroku since the loading time is less of a concern for an individual dashboard than it is for a website.</p>
<p>Once I had decided to use GitHub Pages for hosting I turned my attention to producing the static pages for my site from my Flask application. Developed as is, a Flask application produces pages dynamically from the server. To produce static pages for hosting, you need to use a package called <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a>. This package turns your Flask application into a static pages generator. When the necessary code is added to your application and you run it, a “build” folder is created in your project folder and the files for your static website are generated inside it.</p>
<p>I referred to the code in <a href="https://vkaustubh.github.io/blog/geek/2020-02-23-blogging-with-flask.html">this blog post</a> by Kaustubh Vaghmare when adding the Frozen-Flask related code I needed to produce my static pages.</p>
<p>After adding the necessary code to my app, I created a new GitHub repository for hosting my site, following the steps outlined on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">this GitHub docs page</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I ran my application in “build” mode to produce the static pages and added them to the repository.</p>
<p>At this point I was finally ready to see my website up live online. So I typed the URL into the browser window… drumroll…. hit enter… and… it didn’t work.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Tough Problem: Pages not being generated as html by Frozen-Flask</em></p>
<p>This was the only tough problem I encountered getting my site up and running online. When I ran my flask app in build mode to produce the static pages via frozen-flask only the index (home) page was being generated as html. All the other pages for the site were being produced without any file extensions on them. So when I visited the live site and tried to move from the home page to another page just a "Save file as" window would appear. I Googled to try and find a solution but didn't find much help on this.</p>
<p>Eventually however I did find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/335cyi/a_problem_with_frozenflask/">this Reddit post</a> and a comment explaining that you "need to put <code>.html</code> extensions at the end of your routes". There was also an edit to the comment saying that Frozen-Flask could handle adding the extensions automatically "as long as you include the trailing slash in your route".</p>
<p>I first tried adding trailing slashes to my routes but this ended up creating additional subfolders in my build folder with a new index page for each one. This seemed to actually work to generate the pages with extensions, but it also seemed like a kind of messy solution, so I didn't go with this method. Instead I did as originally suggested in the comment and added <code>.html</code> extensions to all my routes, with the exception of the home route, as shown below in the one for my "About" page.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/about.html&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span>  <span class="nf">about</span><span class="p">():</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render_template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;about.html&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;About&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This worked and all my pages were generated as html.</p>
<hr />
<p>Below is all the code I added to my app to get Frozen-Flask to work:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Added to imports</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Once all the code needed to generate my static pages was added, and the <code>.html</code> extension problem was solved, I was able to run my app in build mode to generate my static pages and add them to my GitHub repository. And it worked! 🥳</p>
<p>The last thing to do was to add my custom domain name. This, of course, is entirely optional but I wanted to give it a try. I'm in Korea, and when I went to try and register a domain through one of the more common providers, like <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a>, I found that Korea was not among the countries in which the service is available. So I decided to use a local Korean provider called <a href="https://www.halfdomain.co.kr/index">반값도메인/Ban-gap Domain</a>. It was actually pretty easy, and inexpensive, to get my domain through this service and it was cheaper to use a <code>.kr</code> domain so that's what I chose. Finally, I followed the instructions in <a href="https://blog.naver.com/daouidc/220738630973">this blog post (Korean)</a> to create a CNAME record with my domain provider that points to the default GitHub pages site, and the instructions on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">this GitHub docs page</a> to set up my custom domain.</p>
<p>And that's it. Website built, and now up and running on my own custom domain! 😄</p>
<p>I hope you found this post helpful and thanks for reading.</p>
